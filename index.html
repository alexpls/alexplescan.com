    <h3>
      <strong>Hi, I'm Alex &mdash; a web and mobile developer.</strong>

    <p>
      So what exactly does that mean?
      Well I spend a lot of time indoors punching keyboards, and if I keep
      it up for long enough sometimes a <a href="/projects/">website, app</a>,
      or <a href="/posts/">blog post</a> comes out!

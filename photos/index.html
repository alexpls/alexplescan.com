  <p>
    Outside of development, one of the things that I enjoy doing is taking photos. This is a selection
    of some of my favourites that I've taken recently.

  {% for photo in site.photos reversed %}
  <div class="photo">
    {% picture fullwidth assets/photo/{{photo.filename}} --alt {{photo.alt}}  %}
  </div>
  {% endfor %}

  <p>
    Unlike the rest of this site, which is <a href="https://github.com/alexpls/alexplescan.com">open source</a>
    without a license, I retain copyright on these photos. If you'd like to use one, please get in touch.

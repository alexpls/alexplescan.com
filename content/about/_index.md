Hey, I'm Alex -- a software engineer living in Brisbane, Australia. It's warm here.

I started writing software professionally (as in getting paid for it) about 12 years ago. Before that, I spent a few years doing it unprofessionally (as in *trying* to get paid for it). During this time I've worked across a broad range of products, stacks, and disciplines... but I always return to the web as my favourite platform.

By day, I work at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com), where I spend most of my time on the big and beautiful Ruby on Rails codebase that supports our Support product.

By night, I maintain a few personal projects. [Mailgrip](https://mailgrip.io) is my main one. If you're a cool person that's into RSS (what cool person isn't?) you should give it a try!

Applications I've built as personal projects include:

- [Mailgrip](https://mailgrip.io) (2022) - forward email newsletters to RSS
- [temoji.me](https://temoji.me) (2022) - custom emojis for Slack and Discord
- [acklo](https://acklo.app) (2021) - remote config and feature flag management
- [mailpin](https://mailpin.com) (2020) - permalinks for emails

- SideSwipe (2014) - embeddable knowledge base for web applications
- [i-MID Wallpapers](https://imidwallpapers.com/) (2014) - wallpaper gallery for Honda i-MID displays

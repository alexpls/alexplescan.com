A little while back I wanted to print a poster of Jack Barker's Conjoined Triangles of Success (as featured in the [Silicon Valley TV show](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)>)).

{{< image src="screengrab.jpg" alt="Silicon Valley TV show screengrab" class="ap-post-img" >}}

Since I couldn't find a copy online that was high-res enough for printing, I made one! And now here it is, in case for some reason you also want to print this thing.

[Download the PDF](conjoined_triangles_of_success_poster.pdf) (it's about 4.1MB)

Enjoy and use wisely!
